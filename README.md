# LA-County-Census

This notebook demonstrates how to use Python to pull census data using the Census API, clean and filter it based on geographic features and/or districts you care about, and map the data. This analysis mostly uses variable B19013_001E, or median household income in the last 12 months of 2010 and 2021: https://api.census.gov/data/2010/acs/acs5/groups/B19013.html ; https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5/groups/B19013.html
